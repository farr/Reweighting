# Reweighting samples to account for a population distributions

[![Build paper](https://github.com/farr/Reweighting/actions/workflows/build_paper.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/farr/Reweighting/actions/workflows/build_paper.yml) [![Latest PDF](https://img.shields.io/badge/PDF-latest-orange.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/farr/Reweighting/blob/master-pdf/note/reweighting.pdf)

These notes and examples arose out of a discussion with Tom Callister and others
in the LIGO Rates and Populations group.  They deal with various methods to
re-weight existing samples over posterior distributions for observations to
account for a newly-fitted population distribution.
