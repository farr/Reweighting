# Reweighting samples to account for a population distributions

These notes and examples arose out of a discussion with Tom Callister and others
in the LIGO Rates and Populations group.  They deal with various methods to
re-weight existing samples over posterior distributions for observations to
account for a newly-fitted population distribution.
